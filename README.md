*Python Script to remove saved posts from reddit.*

PRAWS Version: 7.1.0

You must install python 3.9 and PRAW v7.1.0! If you do not know how a google search will help.

Copy and save the file above.

Make sure to fill in the username and password fields below. Make sure you keep the quotes around the fields.

You'll need to make a "user script" in your reddit profile to run this.
Go to https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/
Click on "Develop an app" at the bottom.
Give it a random name. Doesn't matter.
You need to fill in the "Redirect URI" field with something so go ahead and put 127.0.0.0 in there.
Save it.

The client ID is the 14 character string under the name you gave your script.
It'll look like a bunch of random characters like this: pspYLwDoci9z_A
The client secret is the longer string next to "secret".
Replace those two fields below. Again keep the quotes around the fields.

Save this file as "clearposts.py"

Double click the file to run it.

You are good to go!

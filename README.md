# clearsavedposts
*Python Script to remove saved posts from reddit.*

PRAWS Version: 7.1.0

You must install python 3.9 and PRAW v7.1.0! If you do not know how a google search will help.<br/><br/>

Copy and save the "clearposts.py" file above.<br/><br/>

Make sure to fill in the username and password fields below. Make sure you keep the quotes around the fields.

You'll need to make a "user script" in your reddit profile to run this.
Go to https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/

Click on "Develop an app" at the bottom.

Give it a random name. Doesn't matter.

You need to fill in the "Redirect URI" field with something so go ahead and put 127.0.0.0 in there.

Save it. <br/><br/>

The client ID is the 14 character string under the name you gave your script.

It'll look like a bunch of random characters like this: pspYLwDoci9z_A

The client secret is the longer string next to "secret".

Replace those two fields below. Again keep the quotes around the fields.

Save it.<br/><br/>

Double click the file to run it.<br/><br/>

You are good to go!
